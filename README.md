# Crypto Exchange

This project is a **basic cryptocurrency exchange backend** implemented in Go.  
It focuses on building the core components required for an exchange, such as order handling, matching logic, and internal state management.

The goal of this project is to understand how exchanges work internally — including how orders are processed, matched, and maintained — rather than building a production-ready system.

## Key Ideas

- Order placement and matching logic  
- Basic orderbook structure  
- Modular and extensible backend design  
- Written entirely in Go for performance and simplicity  

## Purpose

This project is intended for:
- Learning how centralized exchanges function internally  
- Experimenting with matching engines and order flow  
- Building a foundation for future features such as persistence, APIs, or real-time updates  

## Status

Work in progress.  
The codebase is actively evolving as new components are added and refined.
